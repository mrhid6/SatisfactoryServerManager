# SatisfactoryServerManager

## Introduction
Satisfactory Server Manager (SSM) is a webpage designed to manage and control multiple satisfactory dedicated server instances.

As a **note** this project has been tested with the Early Access Satisfactory dedicated servers. SSM is subject to change.

## Tests & Approvals:

SSM Has been tested and approved on Windows 10 Pro, Windows Server 2019 and Ubuntu 20.04.

When installing on Windows 10/11 you **MUST** have the Pro edition installed.

It is advised that SSM is installed on one of these operating systems.

If you are running on a Windows 10/11 workstation make sure you have enabled Virtualisation in the BIOS.

## Recommendations:
During our testing we have found that running more than 4 server instances can be detrimental to dedicated server gameplay.

We Recommend not installing SSM in a docker/container but rather on the Host or in a VM.
